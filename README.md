# triggernode
Pd library to create trigger node networks

### Howto 
* point an additional Pd path or `[declare -path]` declaration to the `lib` folder in this repository to make required abstractions accessible
* requires `iemguts` (see Deken)
* open `triggernode-help.pd` to see example

### Notes
`lib` folder will be removed in favour of an actual library repository at some point.
